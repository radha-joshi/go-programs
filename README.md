# Go Design Patterns

## Prerequisites

* Git and Github
* Go programming basics
* Mindset for Go Developer as your identity
* Go version 1.22 and VSCode extension
* Windows
  * Git Bash - to open bash shell as terminal in VSCode

## Object Oriented Programming OOP

* object - holds data and has behaviour
* struct -> object interface -> provide behaviour (methods -> functions with receiver)

## What is covered

* We will cover GoF Design patterns - origin and basis of design patterns in software programming
* If you ask questions you get more information, even outside the session topic

## Important Points

* Awareness of design patterns when designing solutions to requirements
* We want to write clean code
  * Easy to read - code should be self explanatory
  * Maintainable - when we change some code part it should not break another area
  * Testable - we should be able to write test cases to cover regression

## Go Conventions

* Go to document for conventions - to become gofer
* When interface has single method name of interface is chosen to be verb with `er` and ending
* Effective Go

## Go Developer

* Should know what is Go Roadmap and take responsibility of learning

## Creational Patterns

* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

## Structural Patterns

* Adapter
* Decorator
* Composite
* Flyweight
* Bridge
* Proxy
* Facade

## Behavioural Patterns

* Chain of responsibility
* Command
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
